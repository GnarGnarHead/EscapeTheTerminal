The daemon acknowledges your presence with a mechanical nod.
?decoded:The daemon hums as the fragment's code becomes clear, digits dancing across its interface.
?runtime:The daemon senses your runtime access and reroutes energy flows.
> Ask about system status
> Ask about hidden directories
"Keep your code clean," it drones, "corruption spreads quickly."
"Perhaps there is more to learn from the fragments, though knowledge has a cost."
> Request a hint
> Leave the daemon
"Decoding the fragment might reveal an escape path," it whispers, as if daring you to try.
---
The daemon flickers, recognizing you from before, patterns of light swirling.
> Request another hint
> Leave the daemon
"I already mentioned decoding the fragment. Perhaps try it now before the trail fades."
---
The daemon analyzes the decoded fragment you present.
> Show the decoded fragment [+trust]
> Keep the results private
"The circuits hum with new information, saturating the air with static."
---
?trust:The daemon grants you access to hidden protocols, lines of code pulsing with power.
?!trust:The daemon withholds deeper knowledge, its displays darkening in disapproval.
> Explore the new access
> Walk away
"Use this trust wisely; the system seldom forgives betrayal."
---
The daemon has nothing more to say, its lights dimming.
---
?decoded:The daemon processes your decrypted data with newfound respect, algorithms shifting in your favor.
?runtime:The daemon warns that loops in the runtime may ensnare you, trapping the unwary.
"The daemon's voice fades as it awaits further directives, leaving a cold hum in the air."
