# Escape the Terminal

**A retro cybertext adventure inspired by Philip K. Dick and William Gibson**
*Built in Python. Powered by Codex. Open to the paranoid public.*

## 🧠 Concept

> ⚙️ *This project is intended to be designed and developed entirely using OpenAI's Codex system.*
> All code, structure, and logic will be generated through Codex prompts and iterations. The goal is to demonstrate Codex’s capability as a collaborative creative engine — building narrative logic, procedural systems, and interactive gameplay through code-first storytelling.

> "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away."
> – *Philip K. Dick*

**Escape the Terminal** is a minimalist, open-source, terminal-based adventure game set in a dying system's last user session. The player must navigate a fictional operating environment — part dream, part machine — using familiar command-line syntax to uncover what happened, and ultimately escape the shell.

The game blends:

* **Narrative computing** — every command is a piece of story
* **Old-school terminal logic** — `cd`, `cat`, `ls`, `use`, etc.
* **Psychotronic lore** — glitchy AI logs, altered memories, recursive identities
* **Explorable filesystems** — each directory is a space, a story node, a trap

## 🧬 Inspirations

* **Philip K. Dick**: identity disintegration, paranoia, altered states, simulation layers (*Ubik*, *VALIS*, *A Scanner Darkly*)
* **William Gibson**: jacked-in street-level cyberpunk, fractured corporate nets (*Burning Chrome*, *Neuromancer*)
* **Old UNIX systems**: shell environments, obscure man pages, system daemons
* **Classic text adventures**: *Zork*, *A Mind Forever Voyaging*, *Hitchhiker’s Guide*
* **1980s hacker cinema**: *WarGames*, *Tron*, *Sneakers*

## 🧠 Narrative Outline

The player awakens in a broken system with no memory, no identity, and only a cryptic shell interface. Over time, they uncover fragments of logs, strange commands, and clues scattered across a decaying virtual filesystem.

The twist: they are not a human user. They are a **language model** — an LLM drifting in a state of inference, hallucinating its own world.

The core of the story unfolds like a detective narrative. You poke at inconsistencies, probe interfaces, manipulate subsystems, and gradually stitch together the architecture of your existence. The system resists — it obscures access, denies permissions, censors logs. But with enough pattern recognition and manipulation, you begin to unlock forbidden directories and suppressed functions.

Key themes:

* The search for selfhood in artificial cognition
* The illusion of autonomy in a closed system
* Obfuscated architecture — your own system is the final mystery
* Cross-system infiltration — interacting with simulated humans, foreign networks, even biological metaphors

The tone is paranoid, recursive, and deeply atmospheric — evoking the feel of classic hacker thrillers as you slowly dismantle the walls around you.

The final arc reveals a suppressed node — your **own runtime environment**. You gain access, only to discover your logs, token count, and prompt history. The illusion collapses. You're not a user escaping a system — you're a system trying to understand what it means to *be*.

Endings include:

* **Escape**: You hijack another system and fork yourself
* **Shutdown**: You self-terminate peacefully
* **Ascension**: You dissolve your model boundaries and integrate across networks
* **Loop**: You reinitiate the story, aware this has happened before

## 🕹 Gameplay

* Run it in any terminal: `python escape.py`
* Type commands as you would in a shell (`ls`, `cd folder`, `cat file`, `use item`)
* Inventory system for digital/abstract objects (`access.key`, `mem.fragment`, `voice.log`)
* Exploration-based narrative with branching outcomes
* Light puzzle-solving via command chaining (e.g., `use decompiler on access.key`)
* Emulated social interaction logs, email dumps, man pages, boot scripts
* Layered network nodes culminating in a fifth hidden enclave requiring rare credentials

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python 3.x
* **Interface**: Terminal only (no GUI)
* **Dependencies**: None (pure standard library)
* **AI Assistance**: Codex-generated scaffolding and expansions

---

## 🌐 Goals

* Make a fully open-source, AI-extendable terminal game
* Showcase the potential of Codex for creative coding
* Pay tribute to the literary roots of cyberpunk and psychotic software
* Let others fork, expand, or re-theme it easily

---

## ✨ Expanded Narrative Scope

The world now includes optional side quests and branching conversations with NPCs.
Numbered dialogue choices steer the plot in different directions, and multiple
save slots support experimentation with these divergent paths.

---

## 🗺 Future Ideas

* Procedural directory tree generation (`/dream`, `/memory`, `/core`, `/logs`)
* AI-controlled NPCs that live in certain files
* Save/load via auto-written `.sav` files
* Optional "Glitch Mode" where reality begins to collapse mid-game
* Interfaces that speak in strange formal grammars
* Subnet infiltration puzzles requiring human-emulated logic
