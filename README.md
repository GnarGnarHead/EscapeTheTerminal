# EscapeTheTerminal
A retro cybertext adventure inspired by Philip K. Dick and William Gibson.

## Overview
**Escape the Terminal** is a minimalist, open-source adventure that plays out
entirely in your shell. The player awakens inside a decaying system and must use
familiar command-line syntax (`ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `use`, etc.) to explore files,
uncover logs and ultimately break free. The project is written in Python and was
conceived through OpenAI Codex, as outlined in `VISIONDOCUMENT.md`.
The file `escape.py` contains an early prototype you can try today. Run it and type `help` to see the available commands.

## Running the Game
1. Install Python 3.x on your system.
2. Clone this repository and navigate into it.
3. Run the game with:

   ```bash
   python escape.py
   ```

No additional dependencies are required; everything uses the Python standard
library.
